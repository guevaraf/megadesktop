### This is a forking from Mega Desktop
https://github.com/sybil-sink/megadesktop

Which is a great tool for accesing Mega in an explorer kind of fashion. Though it is still in a ruff state regarding usability
and responsiveness.

I forked this project out to help improve the usage of WPF and the look & feel of the app.

Also, to improve both application's (Desktop & Sync) functionality. The objective is to have something as good as 
TortoiseSVN for exploring and as Dropbox's sync app...or even better, ;).

### Hi there! (I'm leaving this as a description)
Mega Desktop is a Windows client for Mega.co.nz service. 
Currently we support anonymous and registered Mega's accounts, simple uploading/downloading files, and sync.
The synch needs more testing though. [Follow us](https://twitter.com/Mega_Desktop) for the fresh news!

### Changes
- New and improved UI
